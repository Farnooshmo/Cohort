Afternoon Task: Functions, methods and for comprehensions
MVP:
Imagine you’re modelling an animal sanctuary in Scala code. What type of Scala constructs
would you use? Your task is to first plan it, then to code it.
TO NOTE: This is the first slightly larger, slightly more ambiguous task of the course.Think about
making your code clean and readable (hence why the planning is important)!

Extension:
• Do some research into a sealed trait. Use these to represent
different diet types.
• Create an object to represent the sanctuary and add some
animals to it.
• Add some other animals/ animal groups to the model (e.g.
domesticated).
Research:
• What’s the difference between an abstract class and a trait? Why might you use one over
the other?
